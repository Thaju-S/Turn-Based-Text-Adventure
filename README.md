# Turn-Based-Text-Adventure
A small text adventure game where you play as a border inspection officer (definitely a completely original idea that isn't at all ripping-off another very popular video game)

# How To Install
1. Make sure you have the latest versions of Java and Maven, as well as an IDE that can run both of them.

2. a). If you have Git installed, go to your terminal and type this command:
```
git clone https://github.com/Thaju-S/Turn-Based-Text-Adventure.git
```
(You can also add the path of where you want to keep the project at the end of the code.)

2. b) Alternatively, if you don't have Git installed, click the green "<> Code" button on the Github page, click the "Download Zip" button, and extract the zip file after it has downloaded.

3. Import the project into your IDE and compile.

4. If the project doesn't work due to unrecognized symbols, go to the terminal in the IDE and run this code:
```
cd <path of the turnbasedrpg file without the arrows>
mvn clean install
```

5. Play.
