# Turn-Based-Text-Adventure
A small text adventure game where you play as a border inspection officer (definitely a completely original idea that isn't at all ripping-off another very popular video game)

# How To Install
1. Make sure you have the latest versions of JDK and Git, as well as an IDE that can run Java.

2. Go to your terminal (or Git Bash if you are on Windows) and type this command:
    git clone https://github.com/Thaju-S/Turn-Based-Text-Adventure.git

3. Locate the downloaded file and import it into your IDE.

4. Compile and run.
