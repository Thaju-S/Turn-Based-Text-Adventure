# Turn-Based-Text-Adventure
A small text adventure game where you play as a border inspection officer (definitely a completely original idea that isn't at all ripping-off another very popular video game)

# How To Install
1. Make sure you have the latest versions of Java and Git, as well as an IDE that can run Java and Maven (may require installing plugins to support Maven).

2. Go to your terminal and type this command:
`git clone https://github.com/Thaju-S/Turn-Based-Text-Adventure.git <insert the location of where you want to keep the project here>`

3. Import the project into your IDE.

4. Compile and run.

# Troubleshooting
-Double check if you have the latest versions of Java and Git by going to your terminal and typing the following commands:

```
java --version
git --version
```

-Check the pom.xml file to make sure that all the dependencies are correct

-In your terminal, navigate to the directory with the project with these commanda (requires having Maven installed in your system):

```
cd <location of the project>
mvn compile
```
